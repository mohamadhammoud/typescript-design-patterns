Welcome to the **Design Patterns in TypeScript** repository! This repository contains TypeScript implementations of various design patterns categorized into Structural, Behavioral, and Creational patterns. Each pattern comes with detailed explanations and code examples.

## Benefits of Design Patterns

Design patterns offer numerous benefits in software development:

- Modularity: Design patterns promote modularity, making code easier to understand and maintain.
- Reusability: Patterns enable code reuse, reducing redundancy and increasing productivity.
- Scalability: Patterns help manage complexity as projects grow, ensuring maintainability.
- Flexibility: Patterns allow for flexible code changes, providing proven solutions.
- Readability: Following well-known patterns enhances code readability for other developers.
- Performance: Some patterns optimize performance by reducing resource usage and enhancing efficiency.

## Categories

### Structural Design Patterns

Structural patterns focus on organizing classes and objects to form larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

- Adapter
- Bridge
- Composite
- Decorator
- Facade
- Flyweight
- Proxy

### Behavioral Design Patterns

Behavioral patterns deal with how objects interact and communicate with each other, improving communication and collaboration between objects.

- Chain of Responsibility
- Command
- Interpreter
- Iterator
- Mediator
- Memento
- Observer
- State
- Strategy
- Template
- Visitor

### Creational Design Patterns

Creational patterns focus on the process of object creation, ensuring instantiation is done in a flexible and efficient manner.

- Factory
- Abstract Factory
- Builder
- Prototype
- Singleton

## Usage

Each pattern is accompanied by detailed usage instructions and code examples. Refer to individual pattern documentation for implementation details.
